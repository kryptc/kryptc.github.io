&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;linguistic area&lt;/strong&gt; refers to a geographical area in which, due to borrowing and language contact, languages of a region come to share certain structural or lexical features as a result of their close proximity. The elements shared by these languages are called &lt;strong&gt;areal features&lt;/strong&gt;, and are acquired rather than inherited. Languages are generally classified typologically or genetically; the genetic classification of languages points to the existence of language families, wherein languages can be grouped based on their shared inheritance from a common ancestor. However, a linguistic area is a result of the diffusion of linguistic traits over genetic boundaries so that genetically dissimilar languages or dialects can be grouped together due to common features that they have acquired as a result of contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a recent census, India has about 121 languages belonging to four major language families:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indo-Aryan&lt;/strong&gt; – Marathi, Bangla, Hindi etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dravidian&lt;/strong&gt; – Telugu, Tamil etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austro-Asiatic&lt;/strong&gt; – Mundari, Santhali etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tibeto-Burman&lt;/strong&gt; – Meitei (spoken in Manipur), Gongduk etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these families have a few defining features, for instance, Indo-Aryan languages utilize aspirated consonants while Dravidian languages don’t. Austro-Asiatic languages use glottal stops and circumfixation, and Tibeto-Burman languages are highly tonal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four language families in India have influenced each other over the course of almost 3000 years through political and social contact. Over time, their coexistence has given rise to an underlying pan-Indian linguistic pattern that can be attributed to the Indian Linguistic Area. Linguistic and racial purity is a myth today - the mixing of population through invasions, inter-marriages, trade and migration led to the diffusion of languages in each other. In the olden times, travelers and merchants from all over the subcontinent would interact with others in marketplaces, royal courts, and caravanserais. People speaking different dialects and languages could be found working in the same factory or farm. On the battlefield, soldiers would speak indigenous languages while their superiors would speak different ones. Every major movement of people would result in the movement of their language too; as sultanates, kingdoms and administrations expanded their territories or shifted their capitals, a linguistic assimilation was inevitable. In fact, there is proof of the intermixing of Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages through the pockets of Dravidian-based languages like Brahui and Kurukh in remote areas of Pakistan and interspersed areas of North India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murray B. Emeneau, a prominent American linguist wrote a seminal article called &lt;em&gt;‘India as a Linguistic Area’&lt;/em&gt; where he defined a linguistic area as ‘an area which includes languages belonging to more than one family but showing traits in common’&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/410649?read-now=1&amp;amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A5e26dbe424e95a593788c9e1e61c8f32&amp;amp;seq=8#page_scan_tab_contents&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent’s Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages shared a number of areal features including retroflex consonants, echo words, subject–object–verb word order, discourse markers, and the quotative, which came about as the result of extensive borrowing and diffusion. He noted that ‘the end result of the borrowings is that the languages of the two families, Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, seem in many respects more akin to one another than Indo-Aryan does to the other Indo-European languages’. Over centuries, the four language families had converged structurally, such that the languages became similar at am abstractive level, but still maintained their identity with their lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the border village of Kupwar, people speak 3 languages: Kannada, Urdu and Marathi (of which the former is Dravidian and the other two are Indo-Aryan). Most individuals are trilingual in the area, and constantly switch back and forth among these languages. Over time, the varieties have grammatically converged, with the 3 varieties having almost the same word order and morphology, while maintaining a distinct vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structural-and-lexical-similarities&quot;&gt;Structural and Lexical Similarities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common way that languages influence each other is the &lt;strong&gt;exchange of words&lt;/strong&gt;. The exchange is not unidirectional and Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan) words are often found in languages belonging to other languages families of India, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanskrit words in Malayalam like &lt;em&gt;sneham&lt;/em&gt; (സ്നേഹം) from &lt;em&gt;sneh&lt;/em&gt; (स्नेह) and &lt;em&gt;ahaṅkāram&lt;/em&gt; (അഹങ്കാരം) from &lt;em&gt;ahaṅkār&lt;/em&gt; (अहङ्कारः)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Tamil word &lt;em&gt;ulagu&lt;/em&gt; (உலகு) became &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; (लोग्) in Sanskrit, &lt;em&gt;logamu&lt;/em&gt; in Telugu and &lt;em&gt;lok&lt;/em&gt; in Hindi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the same language family, vocabulary is often similar. For instance, ‘name’ is written as &lt;em&gt;pēru&lt;/em&gt; in Telugu, &lt;em&gt;pēr&lt;/em&gt; in Malayalam and &lt;em&gt;peyar&lt;/em&gt; in Tamil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, several &lt;strong&gt;phonetic traits&lt;/strong&gt; are common to Indian languages, like the hard retroflex ‘t-’ from tamatar (टमाटर), or voiceless aspirated sounds like ‘kh-’ and ‘ph-’, from &lt;em&gt;khana&lt;/em&gt; (खाना) and &lt;em&gt;phool&lt;/em&gt; (फूल). These sounds are so widespread that they are even found in isolated languages like Andamanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence goes deeper than this, and features related to the morphology and grammar of these language families are exchanged. For instance, Nepal Bhasa (Newar) is a Sino-Tibetan language distantly related to Chinese but owing to its contact with neighbouring Indo-Iranian languages, has developed traits like &lt;strong&gt;noun inflection&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;verb tenses&lt;/strong&gt; that are typical of Indo-European languages, but rare in Sino-Tibetan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;People dancing at the Nagaland Hornbill Festival&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of family, most Indian languages follow a &lt;strong&gt;Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)&lt;/strong&gt; typological structure. Consider the sentence “The boy throws the ball”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Malayalam: &lt;em&gt;kuṭṭi pant eṟiyunnu&lt;/em&gt; (കുട്ടി പന്ത് എറിയുന്നു)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hindi: &lt;em&gt;ladaka gend phenkata hai&lt;/em&gt; (लड़का गेंद फेंकता है)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nepali: &lt;em&gt;kēṭālē bala phyālcha&lt;/em&gt; (केटाले बल फ्याल्छ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the subject (the boy / &lt;em&gt;kuṭṭi&lt;/em&gt;) is followed by the object (the ball / &lt;em&gt;pant&lt;/em&gt;) and ends with the verb (throws / &lt;em&gt;eṟiyunnu&lt;/em&gt;). However, this is not always the case. Tibeto-Burman languages like Karenic and Baic have SVO (subject–verb–object) word order, like Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Indian languages are also &lt;strong&gt;morphologically rich&lt;/strong&gt;, which means they have a relatively free words order. Unlike the syntax-heavy English, Indian languages allows ‘word chunks’ to move, as the morphological elements carry a lot of grammatical information. Consider the sentence “The girl hit the boy”. If we switch the subject and object, we get “The boy hit the girl”, which doesn’t mean the same. However, in Hindi, the same sentence “&lt;em&gt;ladki ne ladke ko mara&lt;/em&gt;” can be rewritten as “&lt;em&gt;ladke ko ladki ne mara&lt;/em&gt;” and the meaning would remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common feature is the &lt;strong&gt;pro-drop&lt;/strong&gt;, where redundant pronouns (pleonastic expletives) are not used. The sentence “It is raining” contains the pronoun ‘it’ which is semantically vacuous. In Tamil, the same sentence would be written as &lt;em&gt;maḻai peykiṟatu&lt;/em&gt; (மழை பெய்கிறது) without a pronoun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most languages are &lt;strong&gt;left-branching&lt;/strong&gt; (with respect to their parse tree) and use postpositions. In Burmese, the phrase “over the table” translates to &lt;em&gt;hcarr pwal kyaw&lt;/em&gt; (စားပွဲကျော်) where &lt;em&gt;kyaw&lt;/em&gt; is the preposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduplication&lt;/strong&gt; is a feature found in the Indian Linguistic Area. By repeating the base word, we put more emphasis, intensify, imply plurality etc. This can be done on nouns, verbs, adverbs or even adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hindi: &lt;em&gt;ghar-ghar&lt;/em&gt; means ‘every house’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tamil: &lt;em&gt;chinna-chinna&lt;/em&gt; means ‘little’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indian languages, the auxiliary verb follows the main verb. For the sentence “You may go”, the auxiliary ‘may’ is represented in Hindi by ‘&lt;em&gt;sakte&lt;/em&gt;’ and in Malayalam by the ending inflection ‘-am’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hindi: &lt;em&gt;tum ja sakte ho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Malayalam: &lt;em&gt;ninakk pokām&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, time adverbials precede place adverbials. Consider &lt;em&gt;Main tumhe kal institute mein milungi&lt;/em&gt;. This sentence can be translated to “I will meet you in the institute tomorrow”. While the adverbial chunks can be interchanged, this is the standard order of saying it: &lt;em&gt;kal&lt;/em&gt;/’tomorrow’ is said first, and followed by the place ‘institute’. These adverbials are also used in the descending order, In the sentence &lt;em&gt;Mujhe India mein Hyderabad ke IIIT ke gate par milo&lt;/em&gt;, the order in which the adverbials occur starts from the largest (‘India’), followed by ‘Hyderabad’, and keeps getting more specific or smaller as the sentence progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Linguistic Area has many more shared grammatical features, like the usage of the conjunctive participle as a discourse connector, echo words, following a &lt;strong&gt;relative clause + noun + postposition order&lt;/strong&gt; etc. The coexistence of all these language families for centuries while changing each other gradually as a result of their contact is a reminder of the evolutionary nature of language and the social factors that result in its transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.” &lt;cite&gt;― Max Weinreich &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A language is generally understood as a &lt;strong&gt;collection of dialects and linguistic varieties&lt;/strong&gt;. All languages exhibit some form of internal variation, and exist in a number of different varieties. However, when we normally talk about a language, we refer to the variety that is standardized and accepted by society as the ‘proper’ language. Here, the line separating a dialect from a language has always been a bit blurred. A common belief is that a dialect is a ‘&lt;em&gt;local, non-prestigious and powerless variety of a real language&lt;/em&gt;’. It is often thought of as a substandard language that is excluded from polite society, and connotes various degrees of inferiority (that is passed on to the speakers of a dialect too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linguistically speaking, there is no difference between the accepted variety of a language and its dialects. They are both regular and have rule-governed systems. No single linguistic system can be shown to be inherently better, so the usage of a dialect provides neither an advantage nor a disadvantage. The decision to call a particular variety ‘a language’ depends on the amount of power held by the speakers of that variety over other dialects. A language is afforded more prestige than a dialect, and is set as the ideal to strive towards. Thus, a hierarchy is formed that places the speakers of the standard language above dialect speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;criteria-for-a-language&quot;&gt;Criteria for a Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A set of criteria can be used to examine if the empowered variety of a language could be more developed than its dialects, and the sociolinguistic attributes that influence social attitudes to either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardization&lt;/strong&gt; is the sociopolitical process of codifying a language by developing grammars, spelling books, dictionaries etc. leading to the acceptance of a formal set of norms defining “correct usage”. It is a sociopolitical process that involves picking one language variety and deeming it to be socially preferable. Ex: In Kerala, written media in the form of magazines and newspapers originated in the Kottayam district. Till date, the Central Travancore dialect spoken there is regarded as the standard Malayalam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitality&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the existence of a living community of speakers for that language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historicity&lt;/strong&gt; is the sense of identity that a particular group of people finds through using a particular language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt; is the feeling that your language is different from another, and the refusal to be regarded as a dialect of a ‘larger’ language. Ex: the Hindi-Urdu disparity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduction&lt;/strong&gt; happens when a particular variety is regarded as a sub-variety due to the lack of opportunities afforded to its users, or restrictions in its use. Ex: Nagamese Creole (pidgin Assamese) is structurally reduced and cannot represent gender.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixture&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the feelings the speakers have about the ‘purity’ of the variety they speak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De Facto Norms&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the feeling that there are ‘good’ and ‘bad’ speakers of a language and the good speakers represent the norms of proper usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-political-difference&quot;&gt;A Political Difference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can say two varieties are different from each other because of the disparities in vocabulary, grammatical rules and pronunciation of words. But at what point do they stop being dialects of the same language and turn into two different languages? This question isn’t as straightforward as defining a dialect as the set of mutually intelligible varieties of a language. The decision for something to be called a language or dialect is tied up with how countries identify their boundaries, how many people speak the language and other political considerations. For instance, Hindi and Urdu are essentially the same language, but are considered separate and even have different scripts. Their differences were magnified for political and religious reasons, and are now symbolic of the differences between India and Pakistan. Conversely, in China, Cantonese and Mandarin speakers cannot understand each other, and yet they will insist that they are speaking different dialects of Chinese, and not different languages. For them, a shared writing system and a strong tradition of political, social, and cultural unity form essential parts of their definition of language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within India, the Hindi dialects spoken in the northern Hindi-Urdu Belt form a dialect continuum. Speakers of dialects that are geographically close to each other can understand each other, but it is improbable that a speaker of Marwari (Rajasthan) would understand someone talking in a Bhojpuri (Bihar) dialect due to all the differences accumulated in their varieties. On the other hand, people living in the border district of Palakkad use a dialect of Malayalam with distinct Tamil intonations, and can understand their Tamil-speaking counterparts in Coimbatore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-aspects&quot;&gt;Social Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from regions, dialects can also be an indicator of what social class you belong to. These are called sociolects. A sociolect can indicate your age, caste, occupation, education, racial or ethnic origin and can be categorized as socially prestigious or socially stigmatized. In a caste-based system like India, less educated people try to emulate the upper-caste sociolect by avoiding some sounds from their pronounciation (eg: the /r/ sound). In Kerala, the &lt;em&gt;Kadappuram dialect&lt;/em&gt; used by fisherfolk is looked down upon while in Mumbai, there is a stigma associated with people who use &lt;em&gt;Tapori Hindi&lt;/em&gt; as it is assumed that uneducated, lower-income groups speak this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-full caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/village-school.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rural school&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A school in a rural Indian village&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inherent bias seeps into the education sector too. Children are often educated in the ‘prestige language’, be it liturgical (Sanskrit) or secular (English), or in the language of wider communication in the area, even if it is different from one’s home language. The regional dialects of a child are often ignored and actively discouraged. This can have far-reaching consequences. Learning is claimed to be better and more successful when conducted in the variety spoken by students as it enhances their social, cognitive, emotional and linguistic development. A classroom may have children from varying backgrounds and to them, their dialect is a part of their heritage and group identity as well as an instrument for the expression of culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a multilingual and multidialectal society like India, a standard variety is used to equalize society. But many dialects and marginalized local languages face extinction due to this rampant standardization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://homegrown.co.in/article/36928/one-mans-fight-to-preserve-nihali-an-indian-language-like-none-other&quot;&gt;Nihali&lt;/a&gt; is a language isolate spoken in Jalgaon Jahod in Maharashtra by around 2500 people. However, no tribal language is taught in the schools of Maharashtra. Even if a child speaks Nihali at home, once he enters a classroom, he instantly switches to Marathi. The continued disregard for the indigenous language or dialect might result in its vanishment. The use of the non-standard dialects in education helps the elevation of the status of the dialects in a society, erases the stigma associated with them and prevents their possible extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Basic Rules For Walking In The Mountains</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, and United Kingdom,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hiking&lt;/strong&gt; refers to walking outdoors on a trail, or off trail, for recreational purposes. A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day. However, in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common word for both features there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand&quot;&gt;New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt; are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips), walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran and in the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as thru-hiking in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping, are referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(wilderness)&quot;&gt;backpacking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-distance-hiking&quot;&gt;Long Distance Hiking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long distance paths, including the National Trails in England and Wales, the National Trail System in the USA and The Grande Randonnée (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Holland), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the Alps of Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours are often made from ‘hut-to-hut’, using an extensive system of mountain huts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (Britain), trail (USA), The Grande Randonnée (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long distance paths, include the Appalachian Trail in the USA and the Pennine Way in Britain. Pilgrimage routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long distance routes, and the route taken by the British National Trail the North Downs Way closely follows that of the Pilgrims’ Way to Canterbury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hiking times can be estimated by Naismith’s rule or Tobler’s hiking function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of “Ten Essentials” equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits.”
&lt;cite&gt;― Cindy Ross&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;environmental-impact&quot;&gt;Environmental Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. ‘Catholes’ dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.

                <title>How to Set Up Your New iPhone 6 the Right Way</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6 Plus&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone&quot;&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt; designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The devices are part of the iPhone series and were unveiled on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly serve as successors to the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus include a number of changes over their predecessor, including models with larger 4.7 and 5.5 inches (120 and 140 mm) displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near field communications-based mobile payments offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded four million within its first 24 hours of availability—an Apple record. More than ten million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, another Apple record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 9, 2015, the 128 GB version of both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price due to the release of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_6S&quot;&gt;iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus flagship devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centered around the device’s size; the majority of iPhone models have used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The last change in size for the iPhone series came with the iPhone 5; the phone and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple’s loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated the possibility that Apple would use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what iPhone is. OK? So, we’re going to reinvent the phone. &lt;cite&gt;- Steve Jobs, 2007.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014. The event featured other previously-rumored product announcements by Apple alongside the new iPhone models, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay&quot;&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; mobile payment platform, and the company’s entry into the wearable computing market with the Apple Watch smart watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were unveiled on September 9, 2014 and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$649 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$749. In China, where the iPhone 5S and 5C were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers that it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China on the 19th because there were “details which are not ready”; local media reported that the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged that iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7’s “frequent locations” function could expose “state secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 2015 Apple admitted that some iPhone 6 Plus may have faulty cameras that could be causing photos to look blurry and initiated a replacement program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 9, 2015 the 128 GB version of both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price due to the release of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus flagship devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;specifications&quot;&gt;Specifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna. Both models come in gold, silver, and “space gray” finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, with the iPhone 6 being Apple’s thinnest phone to date. The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as “Retina HD Display” and “ion-strengthened”, the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 PPI, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed “dual-domain pixels”; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in pattern, so that every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the power button was moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility. The iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features a 11.1 Wh (2915 mAh) battery. Unlike the previous model, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, and has a slight “bulge” around the lens. It has a dual-core 1.4 GHz Cyclone processor (ARM v8-based).

                <title>The Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Working from Home</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A work at home parent is an entrepreneur who works from home and integrates parenting into his or her business activities. They are sometimes referred to as a WAHM &lt;em&gt;(work at home mom)&lt;/em&gt; or a WAHD &lt;em&gt;(work at home dad)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs choose to run businesses from home for a variety of reasons, including lower business expenses, personal health limitations, eliminating commuting, or in order to have a more flexible schedule. This flexibility can give an entrepreneur more options when planning tasks, business and non-business, including parenting duties. While some home-based entrepreneurs opt for childcare outside the home,[1] others integrate child rearing into their work day and workspace. The latter are considered work-at-home parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many WAHPs start home-based businesses in order to care for their children while still creating income. The desire to care for one’s own children, the incompatibility of a 9-to-5 work day with school hours or sick days, and the expense of childcare prompt many parents to change or leave their jobs in the workforce to be available to their children. Many WAHPs build a business schedule that can be integrated with their parenting duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fusion Festival combines all styles of the underground electronic music scene and various other styles, sometimes depending on the attendees who choose to play their own music. It is described as a space people go to free their minds from their everyday lives, jobs, studies and other responsibilities. It is the result of the search for an alternative through music, to the system “people are forced to live in”. People go to the Fusion to experience a different way of socializing and living, where experiencing one another freely, sharing love for music and art connects different scenes and minds. It is a clothing-optional event. Art installations include performance arts, static artworks, sculptures, art cars and various other forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusion Festival began in 1997 near the city of Lärz in north-eastern Germany, about 160 km from Berlin and 230 km from Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;festival-site&quot;&gt;Festival Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location is on the original grass-covered grounds of a disused military airfield (at 53°20′48.11″N 12°44′23.25″E for the 234-hectare area central field) about 4.5 km (2.25 miles) due north of the modern Rechlin-Lärz Airfield facility. The site was first acquired by the German Empire in 1916 as an aviation research and training ground, opening the facility for use by the Luftstreitkräfte in August 1918. After the establishment of the Luftwaffe in 1935, the field served as the Erprobungsstelle Rechlin central military aircraft test facility of the Third Reich through early 1945, and it was captured by the Soviet Red Army on May 2, 1945, for use by the VVS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are grass-covered concrete hangars (actual bunkers) from that time that were used for Soviet fighter aircraft (hence the Cyrillic transliteration of the festival name and various stages, as many Cyrillic inscriptions were still present on the site). The airfield was reopened for civilian use in 1994 and sold to the Müritz Airpark Group in 2010. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Festival&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
