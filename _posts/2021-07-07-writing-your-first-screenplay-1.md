Opinion pieces on how to get started on writing your first screenplay are a dime a dozen. Some of them are actually useful, some of them parrot glib mantras back at you, while some of them annoy you enough to make you wish you never quit your day job. I don’t pretend to know better than any of those people – in fact, I can guarantee you that I know much lesser than any of them, due to the simple fact that I’m 21 and I’ve never written a complete piece of fiction in my life, let alone a screenplay.

So why am I writing this? It’s primarily because I want to get started on my first screenplay and thought I’d write out the process of achieving my goal, so I can inadvertently get closer to the achievement itself. Unlike the rest of this blog, this isn’t something I pulled out of my ass. Learning by teaching is one of the most effective ways of learning. Learning by teaching, however, is not a very effective way of teaching so if you’re reading this, maybe take it with a grain of salt. Moreover, any writing practice is good writing practice so there’s that too. I need to be careful to not do too good a job on this or I’ll end up being a bit too satisfied with this and call it a day. Lastly, I just want to fill up my blog with stuff I didn’t write for college credits.

### 1.	The Idea

The all-important, mightiest of the mighty, don’t-even-bother-starting-without-this component. I can’t stress this enough, you cannot start writing without knowing what you want to write about. Different schools of thought define a starting idea in different ways – some of them say that you need to start with a story, or a message to be delivered, while others say you need to know your characters. According to me, it could be anything. You end up with a different product depending on how you formulate your starting idea. It could be a character whose journey you want to build a story around, or a story you want to place your character in, or even a setting you want to elicit with your story and characters. 

So how do you happen upon this Idea? It could come to you in a flash of inspiration as you belt showtunes in the shower, or if you’re on a deadline, it could come once you sit at your desk with no distractions and actually think about possible ideas. Go through a list of characters and stories you’ve seen in real life or on screen and dissect it so you can separate out the elements that were added by the creator (in the case of content) and bring out just the skeleton. This might feel inorganic to you, but it doesn’t matter – this is just the starting point; you’ve got an entire script to make it feel as inspired and original as you’d like.

### 2.	Catching Jellyfish

It’s very important to write all the bits and snippets you’re thinking about somewhere. This could be dialogue, or costume ideas, or scenes, or even ideas for a new story. Whatever it is, put it down on a running document so you can come back and refer to this if you ever hit a block. I used to have a document like this for every story I started where I’d write down random dialogues and pretty phrases I wanted to include in a scene before I actually wrote that chapter. If your ideas flow too fast, I’d recommend recording yourself narrating it in whatever jumbled up fashion you wish to, and later transcribing it onto the same doc. There’s no need to be self-conscious about it. If an idea is stupid or embarrassing, it does not matter one bit. Chances are, you probably won’t even use it once you start writing. But it’s important to empty your ideas out somewhere to make space in your brain for new ones. Sometimes, if you’re like me, your brain actively tries to sabotage you and you can’t immediately write down your brilliant ideas the moment you get them simply because your limbs won’t move. In that case, just keep thinking about it, all aspects of it, turn it over and over in your head so that it begins to sprout tentacles and you end up remembering your little jellyfish when you get off bed and finally open up that document.

### 3.	Elbow Grease

You know what I’m about to say. There’s no two ways about this - you’ve got to put in the hours. It does not matter that you have a cool idea if you don’t sit and wrestle with it every day to flesh it out into a working story. You need to consciously bring yourself into a state of mind that is accustomed to regular writing. For that, either set aside a specific amount of time daily to sit with your idea and write out different scenes or character development arcs. Alternatively, try to complete at least one component a day, be it a scene, an act division, a character description etc. Getting started is the hardest part and it’s vital that you push yourself to cross that bridge. This tip isn’t specific to writing screenplays, but rather to practically anything that requires a bit of practice to perfect. It’s something we all know and have heard repeatedly but still rings true. If, by any chance, college has sucked the life and confidence out of you and has left you with little to no motivation for even the most mundane of tasks, forcing yourself to make writing a habit is the only way you can make any sort of progress. 

That’s all I have for now. In the next installment of this beginner’s guide, I shall try to come back with more tips related to the structure of your screenplay and how to go about organizing things on paper as well as in your mind.
