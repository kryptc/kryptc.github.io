<p><strong>Movie</strong>: <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> (Quentin Tarantino, 1992)</p>

<p><strong>Sequence</strong>: The Commode Story (1:06:42 to 1:14:06)</p>

<p>This blog post tries to understand the purpose of this sequence in the movie, and more importantly, the narrative devices used to effectualize the sequence. It also discusses the scene progression and shot composition choices made by Tarantino.</p>

<p>This sequence begins with  Mr. Orange (or Freddy) reading out and eventually narrating ‚Äò<em>The Commode Story</em>‚Äô. The story is a made-up anecdote presented to Joe Cabot, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White by Freddy about a drug deal gone awry. The story is set during the Los Angeles marijuana drought in 1986. At that time, Freddy had struck up another deal which required him to tag along for a sale at a train station. While he waited for the buyer, Freddy went to the men‚Äôs room, carrying the weed with him in a carry-on bag. As luck would have it, there were already four Los Angeles county sheriffs chatting inside, along with a German Shepherd. According to Freddy, they could ‚Äòsmell it, just like that fucking dog‚Äô could. A panicking but quick-thinking Freddy simply played it cool and went about his business, and walked right out again.</p>

<p>The elaborate anecdote is meant to serve as a tool to help the criminals feel like they are getting to know Freddy better; the themes of drug dealing and implicit contempt for the police would also help him gain their acceptance as one of their own. Just as the Cabots felt familiar to Freddy after hearing his story, through a monologue or a few minutes of dialogue between characters, the film audience understands certain intricate characteristics of the criminals - Pink‚Äôs stance against tipping and Blonde‚Äôs loyalty to Joe Cabot among others. From a film maker‚Äôs point of view, the narration of the Commode Story is a tool to condense an eight minute monologue into an acted out sequence that holds the audience‚Äôs attention from start to finish. Through progressing from stationary shots of Freddy simply reading out the script to a shot of him fervently reciting the story within the bathroom sequence shows us the passage of time during which he practiced his script and finally presented it to the Cabots and Larry.</p>

<h3 id="narration-through-storytelling">Narration Through Storytelling</h3>

<p>The story makes the most obvious use of a motif used throughout the movie - <strong>storytelling</strong>. When Holdaway initially explains how to learn all four pages of the script, he tells Freddy to memorize what‚Äôs important and make the rest his own. He basically tells Freddy it‚Äôs about getting into character and saying the story as he perceived it; remembering the details and letting the listener fill in the blanks. All the listeners have access to is the story given to them by the narrator, from a particular point of view, with a particular set of details and context. For us, we are shown snippets of how each character joined the heist and how each of them reacted after the heist. However, just as Freddy left out the part where the deal actually went down, we are not shown the actual heist taking place. Unimportant to the narration of the story yet the plot point around which the story revolves, this portion is filled in by our imagination.</p>

<p>At this point in the story, the premise of the story has been built - a few scenes leading up to the heist have been shown through Blonde‚Äôs and White‚Äôs chapters, as well as the initial responses to its failure through altercations among Blonde, White and Pink. While the first act dealt with pinning the blame on someone and finding out who the rat is, the moment when Orange shoots Blonde and reveals that he is an undercover cop signals the beginning of Act 2. The Commode Story scene comes soon after this turning point and is vital to provide some context about Orange‚Äôs intentions.</p>

<h3 id="shot-1">Shot 1</h3>

<p>The sequence starts with a full shot of Freddy on a rooftop in bright daylight. The mise-en-scene is bare and non-descript, the shot doesn‚Äôt reveal much about their surroundings except by the presence of a turret behind him. The camera tilts up to accommodate Holdaway when he enters the left side of the frame, his back to the camera but angled in such a way so that he‚Äôs facing the central axis of the camera. The shot is another example of a low angle shot used in the film, along with the previously used trunk shot.</p>
