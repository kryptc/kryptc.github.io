I"¬'<p>A <strong>linguistic area</strong> refers to a geographical area in which, due to borrowing and language contact, languages of a region come to share certain structural or lexical features as a result of their close proximity. The elements shared by these languages are called <strong>areal features</strong>, and are acquired rather than inherited. Languages are generally classified typologically or genetically; the genetic classification of languages points to the existence of language families, wherein languages can be grouped based on their shared inheritance from a common ancestor. However, a linguistic area is a result of the diffusion of linguistic traits over genetic boundaries so that genetically dissimilar languages or dialects can be grouped together due to common features that they have acquired as a result of contact.</p>

<p>According to a recent census, India has about 121 languages belonging to four major language families:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Indo-Aryan</strong> â€“ Marathi, Bangla, Hindi etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Dravidian</strong> â€“ Telugu, Tamil etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Austro-Asiatic</strong> â€“ Mundari, Santhali etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Tibeto-Burman</strong> â€“ Meitei (spoken in Manipur), Gongduk etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these families have a few defining features, for instance, Indo-Aryan languages utilize aspirated consonants while Dravidian languages donâ€™t. Austro-Asiatic languages use glottal stops and circumfixation, and Tibeto-Burman languages are highly tonal.</p>

<p>These four language families in India have influenced each other over the course of almost 3000 years through political and social contact. Over time, their coexistence has given rise to an underlying pan-Indian linguistic pattern that can be attributed to the Indian Linguistic Area. Linguistic and racial purity is a myth today - the mixing of population through invasions, inter-marriages, trade and migration led to the diffusion of languages in each other. In the olden times, travelers and merchants from all over the subcontinent would interact with others in marketplaces, royal courts, and caravanserais. People speaking different dialects and languages could be found working in the same factory or farm. On the battlefield, soldiers would speak indigenous languages while their superiors would speak different ones. Every major movement of people would result in the movement of their language too; as sultanates, kingdoms and administrations expanded their territories or shifted their capitals, a linguistic assimilation was inevitable. In fact, there is proof of the intermixing of Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages through the pockets of Dravidian-based languages like Brahui and Kurukh in remote areas of Pakistan and interspersed areas of North India.</p>

<p>Murray B. Emeneau, a prominent American linguist wrote a seminal article called <em>â€˜India as a Linguistic Areaâ€™</em> where he defined a linguistic area as â€˜an area which includes languages belonging to more than one family but showing traits in commonâ€™<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/410649?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A5e26dbe424e95a593788c9e1e61c8f32&amp;seq=8#page_scan_tab_contents">.</a> In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinentâ€™s Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages shared a number of areal features including retroflex consonants, echo words, subjectâ€“objectâ€“verb word order, discourse markers, and the quotative, which came about as the result of extensive borrowing and diffusion. He noted that â€˜the end result of the borrowings is that the languages of the two families, Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, seem in many respects more akin to one another than Indo-Aryan does to the other Indo-European languagesâ€™. Over centuries, the four language families had converged structurally, such that the languages became similar at am abstractive level, but still maintained their identity with their lexicon.</p>

<p>For instance, in the border village of Kupwar, people speak 3 languages: Kannada, Urdu and Marathi (of which the former is Dravidian and the other two are Indo-Aryan). Most individuals are trilingual in the area, and constantly switch back and forth among these languages. Over time, the varieties have grammatically converged, with the 3 varieties having almost the same word order and morphology, while maintaining a distinct vocabulary.</p>

<h2 id="structural-and-lexical-similarities">Structural and Lexical Similarities</h2>

<p>The most common way that languages influence each other is the <strong>exchange of words</strong>. The exchange is not unidirectional and Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan) words are often found in languages belonging to other languages families of India, and vice versa.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sanskrit words in Malayalam like <em>sneham</em> (à´¸àµà´¨àµ‡à´¹à´‚) from <em>sneh</em> (à¤¸à¥à¤¨à¥‡à¤¹) and <em>ahaá¹…kÄram</em> (à´…à´¹à´™àµà´•à´¾à´°à´‚) from <em>ahaá¹…kÄr</em> (à¤…à¤¹à¤™à¥à¤•à¤¾à¤°à¤ƒ)</li>
  <li>The Tamil word <em>ulagu</em> (à®‰à®²à®•à¯) became <em>log</em> (à¤²à¥‹à¤—à¥) in Sanskrit, <em>logamu</em> in Telugu and <em>lok</em> in Hindi.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the same language family, vocabulary is often similar. For instance, â€˜nameâ€™ is written as <em>pÄ“ru</em> in Telugu, <em>pÄ“r</em> in Malayalam and <em>peyar</em> in Tamil.</p>

<p>Similarly, several <strong>phonetic traits</strong> are common to Indian languages, like the hard retroflex â€˜t-â€™ from tamatar (à¤Ÿà¤®à¤¾à¤Ÿà¤°), or voiceless aspirated sounds like â€˜kh-â€™ and â€˜ph-â€™, from <em>khana</em> (à¤–à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾) and <em>phool</em> (à¤«à¥‚à¤²). These sounds are so widespread that they are even found in isolated languages like Andamanese.</p>

<p>The influence goes deeper than this, and features related to the morphology and grammar of these language families are exchanged. For instance, Nepal Bhasa (Newar) is a Sino-Tibetan language distantly related to Chinese but owing to its contact with neighbouring Indo-Iranian languages, has developed traits like <strong>noun inflection</strong> and <strong>verb tenses</strong> that are typical of Indo-European languages, but rare in Sino-Tibetan.</p>

<p>Irrespective of family, most Indian languages follow a <strong>Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)</strong> typological structure. Consider the sentence â€œThe boy throws the ballâ€.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Malayalam: <em>kuá¹­á¹­i pant eá¹Ÿiyunnu</em> (à´•àµà´Ÿàµà´Ÿà´¿ à´ªà´¨àµà´¤àµ à´à´±à´¿à´¯àµà´¨àµà´¨àµ)</li>
  <li>Hindi: <em>ladaka gend phenkata hai</em> (à¤²à¤¡à¤¼à¤•à¤¾ à¤—à¥‡à¤‚à¤¦ à¤«à¥‡à¤‚à¤•à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥ˆ)</li>
  <li>Nepali: <em>kÄ“á¹­ÄlÄ“ bala phyÄlcha</em> (à¤•à¥‡à¤Ÿà¤¾à¤²à¥‡ à¤¬à¤² à¤«à¥à¤¯à¤¾à¤²à¥à¤›)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the subject (the boy / <em>kuá¹­á¹­i</em>) is followed by the object (the ball / <em>pant</em>) and ends with the verb (throws / <em>eá¹Ÿiyunnu</em>). However, this is not always the case. Tibeto-Burman languages like Karenic and Baic have SVO (subjectâ€“verbâ€“object) word order, like Chinese.</p>

<p>Most Indian languages are also <strong>morphologically rich</strong>, which means they have a relatively free words order. Unlike the syntax-heavy English, Indian languages allows â€˜word chunksâ€™ to move, as the morphological elements carry a lot of grammatical information. Consider the sentence â€œThe girl hit the boyâ€. If we switch the subject and object, we get â€œThe boy hit the girlâ€, which doesnâ€™t mean the same. However, in Hindi, the same sentence â€œ<em>ladki ne ladke ko mara</em>â€ can be rewritten as â€œ<em>ladke ko ladki ne mara</em>â€ and the meaning would remain the same.</p>

<p>Another common feature is the <strong>pro-drop</strong>, where redundant pronouns (pleonastic expletives) are not used. The sentence â€œIt is rainingâ€ contains the pronoun â€˜itâ€™ which is semantically vacuous. In Tamil, the same sentence would be written as <em>maá¸»ai peykiá¹Ÿatu</em> (à®®à®´à¯ˆ à®ªà¯†à®¯à¯à®•à®¿à®±à®¤à¯) without a pronoun.</p>

<p>Additionally, most languages are <strong>left-branching</strong> (with respect to their parse tree) and use postpositions. In Burmese, the phrase â€œover the tableâ€ translates to <em>hcarr pwal kyaw</em> (á€…á€¬á€¸á€•á€½á€²á€€á€»á€±á€¬á€º) where <em>kyaw</em> is the preposition.</p>

<p><strong>Reduplication</strong> is a feature found in the Indian Linguistic Area. By repeating the base word, we put more emphasis, intensify, imply plurality etc. This can be done on nouns, verbs, adverbs or even adjectives.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hindi: <em>ghar-ghar</em> means â€˜every houseâ€™</li>
  <li>Tamil: <em>chinna-chinna</em> means â€˜littleâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>In Indian languages, the auxiliary verb follows the main verb. For the sentence â€œYou may goâ€, the auxiliary â€˜mayâ€™ is represented in Hindi by â€˜<em>sakte</em>â€™ and in Malayalam by the ending inflection â€˜-amâ€™.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hindi: <em>tum ja sakte ho</em></li>
  <li>Malayalam: <em>ninakk pokÄm</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, time adverbials precede place adverbials. Consider <em>Main tumhe kal institute mein milungi</em>. This sentence can be translated to â€œI will meet you in the institute tomorrowâ€. While the adverbial chunks can be interchanged, this is the standard order of saying it: <em>kal</em>/â€™tomorrowâ€™ is said first, and followed by the place â€˜instituteâ€™. These adverbials are also used in the descending order, In the sentence <em>Mujhe India mein Hyderabad ke IIIT ke gate par milo</em>, the order in which the adverbials occur starts from the largest (â€˜Indiaâ€™), followed by â€˜Hyderabadâ€™, and keeps getting more specific or smaller as the sentence progresses.</p>

<p>The Indian Linguistic Area has many more shared grammatical features, like the usage of the conjunctive participle as a discourse connector, echo words, following a <strong>relative clause + noun + postposition order</strong> etc. The coexistence of all these language families for centuries while changing each other gradually as a result of their contact is a reminder of the evolutionary nature of language and the social factors that result in its transformation.</p>
