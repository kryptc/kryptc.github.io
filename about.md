Hello! My name is **Kripa Anne** and I'm an associate software engineer at [ABB, Bengaluru](https://global.abb/group/en). I primarily work on the Ability IIoT Edge, a gateway device that sits between IIoT devices and the cloud. It collects and collates telemetry data from the IoT devices, performs various device and module APIs among other things, before forwarding this data to the IoTHub. The tech stack includes a C# codebase, Mosquitto broker, Azure IoT Hub SDK and Docker Swarm/Kubernetes. I am currently working with my team to release an AKS-IoT and an OpenShift Kubernetes Engine implementation of the Edge Agent, which was previously only in Docker Swarm. Prior to this, I was heavily involved in stabilizing and maintaining the Edge through MQTT broker monitoring, Docker container metrics, Serilog integration in the codebase and many more, all of which were monitored via Grafana/Promtail/Loki dashboards. I also developed the Docker credential management feature that improved security on the edge by encrypting the credential registries added to the Edge agent and installer and led it from the POC stage up till testing and release. I was also involved in creating an E2E test automation suite for the Edge functional module using SpecFlow.  

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering and was an Honours research student in the [Information Retrieval and Extraction Lab](https://irel.iiit.ac.in/), a part of the Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC) under Prof. Vasudeva Varma. During my time in IREL, I used to work on a project related to Continuous Style Transfer to build a system that provided embeddings for intermediate styles so as to get control over the degree of change in style. Our architecture used a Denoising Autoencoder and Back Translation model. Problems like these help us get closer to understanding how machines learn language and are fundamental to improving NLP models.

In my free time, I often read and write fiction, play table tennis and make imaginary travel itineraries. Theatre production has always been one of my passions too, so you might occasionally catch me belting showtunes that I should have left alone. However, I love learning about new things, so you can find a mixed bag of articles and essays in my blog!

*Thank you for reading!*
